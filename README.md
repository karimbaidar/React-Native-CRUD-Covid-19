## Note
- I didn't include the android and ios folders. So you can clone the repo and use the necessary modules as per your need and requirments in your own project. 
- The files in this repo could serve as the base for any app from scratch via react native for ios and android. 
- Still more improvements can be done. 


## Suggestions
- Redux has not been used for state management. So I would suggest to modify the project and use it instead. 
- You can use token authentication via spring security plugin in the back-end
- Instead of PHP files, you can use Spring Boot with Java as a back-end tool to communicate JSON via Rest API.
